# Course materials "GitHub (Beginner): Using Git and Github for Open Science & connection with OS repositories for sharing data and codes (OSF and Zenodo)" at the second MPIDR Open Science workshop, March 17-18, 2025, Rostock, Germany

Here is the folder structure and what to expect:

- Root folder
    - This ReadMe.md text file and other files for RStudio project etc.
    - File named ".gitignore" is very important and described how it works in the slides
- guidelines
    - here is the workshop instructions, where to find and install "git", OpenScience workshop program.
    - There is a copy of GitHub education's Git cheat sheet to use.
- slides
    - open the PDF of slides and follow the steps described to know how to use the files in this repository and learn the basic git commands and links for more advanced topics.
- example_plain_text_latex_paper
    - Slides also include instructions how to access an example academic text (paper?) that uses plain text format which is "version-control-friendly". It is an example to showcase the benefits of using Latex for your academic writing.


Note: You can follow the same procedure explained in the slides for any type of writing that uses plain text format such as your R, Python, Stata, SQL and similar scripts and analysis codes. Enjoy coding with version control and reach out if you had questions/doubts e.g., by going into "issues" tab on GitHub repository [https://github.com/akbaritabar/Using-Git-and-GitHub-for-Open-Science-Workshop](https://github.com/akbaritabar/Using-Git-and-GitHub-for-Open-Science-Workshop) and opening a new question.
